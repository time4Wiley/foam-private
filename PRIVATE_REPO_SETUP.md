# Private Repository Setup Status

## Completed Steps

1. ✅ **Created private repository**: `https://github.com/time4Wiley/foam-private`
2. ✅ **Renamed original remote**: `origin` → `official`
3. ✅ **Added private repo as new origin**: `git@github.com:time4Wiley/foam-private.git`
4. ✅ **Created sync alias**: `git sync-private`

## Current Status

The private repository has been created and remotes are configured correctly:
- `official`: git@github.com:foambubble/foam.git (original repo)
- `origin`: git@github.com:time4Wiley/foam-private.git (your private repo)

## Issue Encountered

There's currently a network connectivity issue preventing the initial push to the private repository. This appears to be related to the connection being terminated during the transfer.

## Manual Steps to Complete Setup

Due to the network issues, you'll need to complete the push manually when your connection is stable:

```bash
# Try pushing with these options
git config http.postBuffer 524288000
git push -u origin main --no-thin

# If that fails, try:
# 1. Check your network connection
# 2. Try again later (could be rate limiting)
# 3. Push incrementally:
git push origin HEAD~100:refs/heads/main  # Push older commits first
git push origin HEAD~50:refs/heads/main   # Then more recent
git push origin main                       # Finally current state

# After main is pushed, push other branches:
git push origin --all
git push origin --tags
```

## Using Your Private Repository

Once the push succeeds:

1. **To sync from official repo**:
   ```bash
   git sync-private
   # Or manually:
   git fetch official
   git merge official/main
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **For feature branches**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   # Work on your feature
   git push -u origin feature/my-feature
   ```

3. **To contribute back to official**:
   - Create branches from official/main
   - Push to your private repo
   - Create PR from official repo's fork (you may need to fork it first)

## Repository Settings

Your private repository has been configured as:
- **Visibility**: Private
- **Name**: foam-private
- **Description**: Private copy of Foam repository

Consider disabling unnecessary features:
```bash
gh repo edit time4Wiley/foam-private --enable-issues=false
gh repo edit time4Wiley/foam-private --enable-wiki=false
gh repo edit time4Wiley/foam-private --enable-projects=false
```

## Next Steps

1. Wait for network stability and complete the push
2. Verify all branches and tags are pushed
3. Set up any additional security or access controls needed
4. Consider adding a README to clarify this is a private copy
